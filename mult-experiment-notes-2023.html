<h3> MULTIPLIER EXPERIMENT NOTES 2023</h3>

I collected my notes about gathering benchmarks and running tools for multiplier verification.

<h4> Gathering Benchmarks </h4>

Here is the list of generators we used when generating the designs given in
the paper:

<ol>  <li>  All  combinations  from multiplier  generator  from  Homma/AOKI
Labotory.     The   benchmarks    used   to    be   obtained    here:   <a
href="https://www.ecsis.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/views/amg-e">https://www.ecsis.riec.tohoku.ac.jp/views/amg-e</a>.
However, it seems  this website is taken down now.   For 64x64, we gathered
all the possible  combinations when running our  experiments, which amounts
to 192 different design samples.</li>

<li>A     small    set     of    benchmarks    are     generated    from
  <a href="https://github.com/amahzoon/genmul">https://github.com/amahzoon/genmul</a>. This
generator  does  not  have  Booth  encoding, and  it  was  very  slow  when
generating larger multipliers.</li>

<li> Finally,   a   large   set   of   multiplier   are   generated   using
 <a href="https://github.com/temelmertcan/multgen">https://github.com/temelmertcan/multgen</a>.
For isolated nxn-bit multipliers, we have all the possible combinations for
all sizes  up to  256x256-bit multipliers.   This generator  supports Booth
radix-2/4/8/16.  This generator also creates dot-product, multiply-add, and
truncated and/or shifted multipliers.

<p>  I  used   a  python  script  to  also  create   over  10000  randomly
parameterized benchmarks  from this generator. These  include multiply-add,
dot-product, truncation, shifting, and random  operand sizes. We used these
to stress-test our tool. Other tools do not support these configurations.</p>

<p>
As an example, below are the commands to generate an example testbench:

<code>
  git clone https://github.com/temelmertcan/multgen tem-multgen
</code>
<code>
  cd tem-multgen
</code>
<code>make</code>
<code>
./multgen -type FourMult -tree WT -pp SB4 -adder KS -in1size 32 -in2size 32
</code>
This  will  generate  a  32x32-bit multiplier  with  signed  Booth  radix-4
encoding with Wallace tree and Kogge-Stone  adder. Name of the output file is
<code>Merged_WT_SB4_KS_32x32_noX_multgen.sv</code>      with      top      module      name:
<code>Merged_WT_SB4_KS_32x32_noX</code></p>

<p> The  <tt>noX</tt> suffix indicate  that the  design is free  of Verilog
don't-care (X)  values. VeSCmul  can handle  these cases  but it  seems the
yosys/abc route to generate the AIGs for  other tools do not support Xes in
the  design, so  this  generator  is instructed  to  output  a design  that
specifically  excludes X  values. This  is a  subtle hardware  verification
problem that does not seem to be addressed frequently in publications. </p>

</li>

</ol>

<h4> Running VeSCmul </h4>

<p>  Thousands  of experiments  are  run  for VeSCmul,  including  randomly
genererated     designs.     These     are    packaged     into    a     <a
href="mult-experiments.html">zip  file</a> for  others  to  run easily.   A
makefile  and some  python scripts  create random  designs, run  the proofs
automatically, and  collect them into a  single text file. Only  thing that
users  need  to  do  is  build  ACL2,  which  should  be  a  more  or  less
straightforward process. </p>

<h4> Running RevSCA2</h4>

<ol>

<li> First step  is to create AIGs from Verilog  designs. There are various
ways to do this. I used yosys and  abc because they are easier to call from
shell when running  hundreds or thousands of  experiments. Apparently, this
is what the owners of RevSCA and Amulet also use.

<p> Below  are  the commands we used  to  parse  combinational Verilog  designs  and
   convert them to AIGs:</p>

<code>yosys Merged_WT_SB4_KS_32x32_noX_multgen.sv -p "hierarchy -top Merged_WT_SB4_KS_32x32_noX" -p proc -p techmap -p flatten -o tmp2.blif</code>
<code>abc </code>
<code2>  read "tmp2.blif" </code2> 
<code2>  strash</code2>
<code2>  write "origdesign.aig" </code2>
  
  <p>These commands will create an AIG file named origdesign.aig.</p>
  </li>


<li>       I       pulled      revsca      from      this       git      repo:
<a href="https://github.com/amahzoon/RevSCA-2.0">https://github.com/amahzoon/RevSCA-2.0</a>. It
appears that the source code is  not available and only an executable (that
runs on Linux) is given.</li>

<li>Then revsca2 can be run as follows:</li>

<code>./revsca2 origdesign.aig revsca.out -s</code>

</ol>

<p> Some notes and observations: </p>

<ul>

  <li>I measured the time consumed only when revsca is running  for proof-time averages
    and not Verilog processing times.</li>

<li>For some multipliers (e.g., Merged_WT_SB4_KS_32x32_noX), revsca2 claimed them to
be buggy, and printed:
<code>
"The multiplier is buggy! <br>
Remainder:[1;37m-92233...."</code>

<p>This seems to be a false-negative as Amulet and VeSCmul could prove this
multiplier correct.  For other similar  configurations, revsca said some of
them to  be correct and some  to be buggy,  where all of them  are actually
proved to be correct.</p>

</li>

<li> To run  the 1000+ experiments given  in the paper, I  created a python
script  to  run  all of  them  and  collect  the  results in  a  systematic
manner. </li>

</ul>

<h4> Running AMulet2 </h4>

<ol>

  
<li> Followed the same steps when running Revsca to create AIGs from Verilog:

<code>yosys Merged_WT_SB4_KS_32x32_noX_multgen.sv -p "hierarchy -top Merged_WT_SB4_KS_32x32_noX" -p proc -p techmap -p flatten -o tmp2.blif</code>
<code>abc </code>
<code2>  read "tmp2.blif" </code2> 
<code2>  strash</code2>
<code2>  write "origdesign.aig" </code2>
  
  <p>These commands will create an AIG file named origdesign.aig.</p>
  </li>

<li> Pull AMulet2 from <a target=_blank href="https://github.com/d-kfmnn/amulet2">https://github.com/d-kfmnn/amulet2</a>.</li>


<li>Amulet2 requires other tools to be installed for the complete verification flow. These are:
  <ul> 
    <li>libgmp (https://gmplib.org/) to build amulet2</li>
    <li>Cadical SAT solver to check equivalence after adder substitution. (we used version 1.2.1)</li>
    <li>DRAT-trim to check the proof done by Cadical</li>
    <li>Pacheck2 to check the correctness of proof run by amulet2 (https://github.com/d-kfmnn/pacheck2)</li>
  </ul>
</li>


<li> After building all the tools, below commands are used to verify multipliers and check the proof certificates:

<code>src/amulet2/amulet -substitute origdesign.aig out2.cnf out2.aig</code>
<code>src/cadical/build/cadical out2.cnf out2.proof</code>
<code>src/amulet2/amulet -certify out2.aig out2.polys out2.pac out2.spec -signed</code>
<code>src/drat-trim/drat-trim out2.cnf out2.proof</code>
<code>src/pacheck2/pacheck out2.polys out2.pac out2.spec</code>

</li>

</ol>

<p> Some notes and observations: </p>

<ul>

  <li>I measured  the  total  time  from  these  events  excluding  Verilog
    processing times.</li>
  
  <li> Amulet2  sometimes returned  1, which usually  indicate an  error in
    unix, but apparently this program does  not actually mean an error. For
    example, in the substitute stage, it looks  like returning 0 vs 1 is to
    indicate that the program made a change in the AIG.</li>
  
  <li> Certificates seem  to occupy a large  space in disk. I  did not save
    the exact  numbers but as multipliers  grow, I was running  out of disk
    space  (allocated 200GB). </li>
  
  <li>Some  problem in  Amulet2  seems to  be causing  timeout  in a  large
    majority of the benchmarks I tried. It looks like amulet2 is working ok
    for Homma  designs (#1 multiplier  generator above) but not  others (at
    least #3)  . The  proofs were  running for  a very  long time  even for
    simple 8x8 multipliers. This is observed  in April 2023. I notified the
    owner of the amulet2  repo of the problem. Because of  this, I ended up
    using Amulet1 when I collected proof-time results.</li>

</ul>


<h4> Running AMulet1 </h4>

Very similar to the commands for amulet2. Details may be added later.
