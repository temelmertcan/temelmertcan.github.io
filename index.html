     I got my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in June 2016 from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey. My undergrad studies focused on digital circuits, signal processing and software engineering. I started a Ph.D. bound M.S. program in University of Texas at Austin in August 2016. My M.S. coursework focused on computer architecture with an emphasis on formal verification. I got my M.S. degree in May 2019. I am currently creating an efficient and widely applicable methd for verification of multipliers for my Ph.D. thesis.
