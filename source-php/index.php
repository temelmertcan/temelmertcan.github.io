I am a Formal Verification Engineer at Intel Corporation.  I specialize in formal verification of hardware, particularly datapath. 
   </p>

<p>
     I got my B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in June 2016 from Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey. My undergrad studies focused on digital circuits, signal processing and software engineering. I started a Ph.D. bound M.S. program in University of Texas at Austin in August 2016. My M.S. coursework focused on computer architecture with an emphasis on formal verification. I got my M.S. degree in May 2019. I created an efficient and widely applicable method for verification of multipliers for my Ph.D. thesis.  My dissertation is  </a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/88056">"Automated and Scalable Verification of Integer Multipliers"</a>. I got my PhD in Computer Engineering at University of Texas at Austin in July 2021. I am currently working at Intel Corporation as a formal verification engineer for hardware.
